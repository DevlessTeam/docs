## What and Why DevLess


For the 25+ years the web has existed, we have seen it evolve to become more than a publishing platform. Now we see the web supporting vast majority of businesses. We have also seen the tools surrounding the web evolve as well.
More and more businesses are moving online and the demand and there is the need of solide and advance tools to put these businesses online. But as developers we are flooded with more generic and open tools to build online platforms with. These tools range from SDKs to web frameworks that can be used to build anything that inhabits the web, Most hardly focus on providing right out of the box what businesses need. In short we keep building everything from the ground up for each platform and DevLess looks to chanige that. 

We pick up the challenge and acknowledge the fact that :

- Every business comes with unique requirements 

- Although the underlying technology matters business comes first 

- The best tools provides harmony between developers and business owners

With these assumptions we set out to build DevLess [*DevLess*](https://devless.io) an open source framework for bootstrapping your online business without the bells and whistels 


All that is required of the developer is to write the frontend code ([*JavaScript*](https://www.javascript.com/), [*Android*](https://developer.android.com)\[[*Java*](https://java.com/en/download/)\], iOS\[[*Swift*](https://swift.org/)/[*Objective C*](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)\], etc.)
