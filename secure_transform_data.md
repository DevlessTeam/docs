#Managing your data

DevLess is a plug-and-play back-end that can do many things, but one of the core components is the ability to model and persist data. DevLess uses the relational model for data. This is the same model as any relational database such as mysql or postgresql. 

DevLess allows you to secure your data, as well as transform it before writing and after reading from the data store. Much of this this is handled by using a powerful rules engine.
