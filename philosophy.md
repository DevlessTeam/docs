## CONCEPT

Software is eating up the world but building a new web or mobile apps that scales isn’t easy and gives a lot of developers headache. Building a [*Reddit*](https://reddit.com) clone requires the developer to think about how all the features like comments, upvotes and downvotes, posts, links, etc. integrate seamlessly without breaking the flow of the application. These are just a few of the worries before infrastructure kicks in with it’s own hell. That is why we began work on [*Devless*](https://devless.io) to abstract the pain developers go through to spin up a powerful backend for their apps by building allowing them to build in  a modular and reusable way  which speeds up development, provide scalability and it is cost effective. Now the developer begin to think of his app in terms of features rather than code, UI and UX to differentiate themselves from the numerous apps out there because most times this makes our products or startups unique.

[*Devless*](https://devless.io) is an open-source backend framework that can de deployed on any host of choice. The is also the Devless Hub available from within the framework where developers can have access to pre built modules/services. All that is required of the developer is to write the frontend code ([*JavaScript*](https://www.javascript.com/), [*Android*](https://developer.android.com)\[[*Java*](https://java.com/en/download/)\], iOS\[[*Swift*](https://swift.org/)/[*Objective C*](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)\], etc.) to consume the API endpoints. If the developer’s required features ain’t available, he or she can build the module (service with a lean view) and share with the world through the Devless Hub.
