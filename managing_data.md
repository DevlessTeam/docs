# Managing Data

DevLess is a plug-and-play back-end that can do many things, but one of the core components is the ability to model and persist data.

## Data Model

DevLess uses the relational model for data. This is the same model as any relational database such as mysql or postgresql. 

DevLess uses a relational database as it's backing database and can expose as much as you want to the clients. Controlling what a user is allowed to access or write can be done by using the rules engine. The same is true for manipulation of data before writing or after reading.
