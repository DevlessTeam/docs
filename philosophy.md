## Concept

For the 25+ years the web has existed, we have seen it evolve to become more than a publishing platform. Now we see the web supporting vast majority of businesses. We have also seen the tools surrounding the web evolve as well, from manually creating multiple web pages to automating them with scripts to using frameworks.

These tools improve overtime to support the demand of the ever growing web. We have gotten to that time again where the tools we use on the web is evolving and this  time it involves the improvement of the
client side and the evolution of the backend.

DevLess sets out to join the evolution of the backend frameworks. And yes there are newer backend solutions but most are offered as a service. We believe that you should be handed a log to make your own boat rather than have you use an already made boat like most solutions out there which are SAAS based.

[*DevLess*](https://devless.io) is an open-source backend framework that can be deployed on any host of choice. There is also the DevLess Hub available from within the framework where developers can have access to pre built modules/services.

All that is required of the developer is to write the frontend code ([*JavaScript*](https://www.javascript.com/), [*Android*](https://developer.android.com)\[[*Java*](https://java.com/en/download/)\], iOS\[[*Swift*](https://swift.org/)/[*Objective C*](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)\], etc.) to consume the API endpoints. If the developer's required features isnâ€™t available, he or she can build the module (service with a lean view) and share with the world through the DevLess Hub.
