## CONCEPT

For the 25+ years the web has existed, we have seen it evolve to become more than a publishing platform. Now we see the web supporting vas majority of businesses. We have also seen the tools surrounding the web evolve as well, from manually creating multiple web pages  to automating them with scripts to using frameworks. 

These tools improve overtime to support the demand of the ever growing web. We have gotten to that time again where the tools we use on the web is evolving and this  time it involves the improvement of the 
client side and the evolution of the backend. 

Devless sets out to join on the evolution of the backend frameworks. And yes there exist newer backend solutions most offered as a service. We believe that you should be handed a log to make your boat and not make a boat and get people to use it as most of these solutions are SAAS based.

[*Devless*](https://devless.io) is an open-source backend framework that can be deployed on any host of choice. There is also the Devless Hub available from within the framework where developers can have access to pre built modules/services. 

All that is required of the developer is to write the frontend code ([*JavaScript*](https://www.javascript.com/), [*Android*](https://developer.android.com)\[[*Java*](https://java.com/en/download/)\], iOS\[[*Swift*](https://swift.org/)/[*Objective C*](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)\], etc.) to consume the API endpoints. If the developers required features ainâ€™t available, he or she can build the module (service with a lean view) and share with the world through the Devless Hub.
