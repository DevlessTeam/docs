You create services when you have a new functionality you want to add to your app. DevLess also provide some more functionalities out of the box that are only accessible within other services you create.

Installation

To install a service, you can either use the service hub or import it manually. The service hub contains a list of services maintained by the DevLess team and is accessible from the "Service Hub" tab in your DevLess UI. You can also manually import services using the "Migration" tool, which can also be found in your DevLess UI.
