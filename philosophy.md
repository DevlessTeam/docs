## CONCEPT

Software is eating up the world but building a new web or mobile apps that scales isn’t easy and gives a lot of developers headache. Building a [*Reddit*](https://reddit.com) clone requires the developer to think about how all the features like comments, upvotes and downvotes, posts, links, etc. integrate seamlessly without breaking the flow of the application. These are just a few of the worries before infrastructure kicks with it’s own hell. That is why we began developing [*Devless*](https://devless.io) to abstract the pain developers go through to spin up a powerful backend for their apps by building in a modular components which speeds up development, provide scalability and it is cost effective. Now the developer begin to think of his app in terms of features rather than code, UI and UX to differentiate themselves from the numerous apps out there because most of the time this makes our products or startups successful.

[*Devless*](https://devless.io) is an open-source Rest-API endpoint generator backend framework on any host of choice where the developer can grab the features of their apps from the [*Devless*](https://devless.io) marketplace and import it into the backend framework to have a fully functional backend services. All that is required of the developer is to write the frontend code ([*JavaScript*](https://www.javascript.com/), [*Android*](https://developer.android.com)\[[*Java*](https://java.com/en/download/)\], iOS\[[*Swift*](https://swift.org/)/[*Objective C*](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)\], etc.) to consume the API endpoints. If the developer’s required features ain’t available, he or she can build the module (service with a lean view) and enlist it on the marketplace to earn money.

[*Devless*](https://devless.io) comes in two versions; the local version for any OS and the cloud version with add-ons in form of product features.
