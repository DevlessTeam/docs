# Introduction

Devless is a tool for ready-made back-end for development of web or mobile applications. It is fully open source under the permissive Apache v2 license. This means that you can develop your front end without worrying about neither back-end code or the business risk of a propitiatory backend-as-a-service.

## Video tutorials

There is a set of video tutorials available on the [Devless Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRNPvrhMwFczppgthkzv44A), which complements these docs. Many of the videos are linked from different parts of the docs. If you want to start with one, have a look at [What and why to use DevLess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1Wzu7LeYv4).
